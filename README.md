This repository contains the code and data used in the paper:

**ScanClimatePolicy: A Framework for Analyzing Sectoral Climate Policies and Their Environmental Impact**

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is provided in the [`data/`](data/) folder.

Due to size constraints, the data is hosted externally. Please see the `README.md` inside the `data/` folder for download instructions and additional dataset details.

## Usage

The analysis is organized into Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebook/` folder. Each notebook corresponds to a specific research question (RQ):

- `rq1.ipynb` — Analysis for Research Question 1  
- `rq2/` — Contains sub-analysis and additional notebooks for Research Question 2  
- `rq3.ipynb` — Analysis for Research Question 3  
- `discussion/` — Contains summary discussions and insights

To run the project:

1. Download the dataset (see `data/README.md`).
2. Ensure all extracted files are placed in the `data/` directory.
3. Open and run the notebooks in your preferred Jupyter environment.
